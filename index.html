<h1>Dear Friends, Colleagues, and Future Partners,</h1>

<p>As I reflect on the past decade, I am excited to share with you the journey that has led me to where I am today.</p>

<p>After graduating from college in 2012, I embarked on a career in the metal industry, driven by a passion for sustainability and a fascination with the global supply chain. My first stop was ELG, a leading supplier of raw materials for the stainless steel industry, where I spent eight years honing my skills and becoming the largest stainless scrap buyer on the East coast of North America.</p>

<p>One of the highlights of my time at ELG was the extensive global travel I undertook to steel and mining hubs worldwide. From the mountains of Chile to the factories of China, I had the privilege of experiencing different cultures and meeting incredible people. Always by my side was my trusty camera, capturing the beauty of the places I visited, and more recently, my loyal border collie Letty. Rescued from Leadville, Colorado in January 2022, Letty has been my constant companion on my adventures.</p>

<p>During my time at ELG, I had the privilege of working under the ownership of Franz Haniel & Cie. GmbH, a 267-year-old family-owned company that instilled in me the values of long-term thinking, integrity, and sustainable business practices. I was also part of a pioneering team that embarked on a global digitization and AI project, spanning Europe and beyond. Led by one of ELG's most senior executives, our team collaborated with world-class innovators, angel investors, entrepreneurs, and consultants to reinvent the steel industry for the future. This experience not only broadened my perspective but also deepened my understanding of the transformative power of technology and innovation.</p>

<p>In 2021, I took on a new challenge as the head of the global recycling program at Kennametal, a publicly traded company and leader in metal cutting and wear-resistant solutions. This experience further solidified my commitment to closed-loop production and sustainable practices.</p>

<p>Today, I am thrilled to announce that I have launched my own global scrap metal business, dedicated to revolutionizing the industry through transparency, technology, and trust. My mission is to create a more sustainable future by closing the loop on metal production and promoting responsible sourcing practices.</p>

<p>As I embark on this new chapter, I invite you to join me on this journey. Whether you are a potential customer, partner, or team member, I believe that together, we can make a meaningful impact on the industry and the environment.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time, and I look forward to connecting soon.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Theodore Pynos</p>
