I did not plan on writing my fucking autobiography today, trust me. I'm an underachieving, self-loathing 35 year old.

I could point out that the inspiration for the title of this document was not inspired by "him," it was inspired by another book I actually read. I'm not going to point that out to you, though. I don't have to. I don't have to explain anything to you, but some things I will. Things that pertain to my life and my legacy. Legacy is intimidating, I know. I've been working on it my entire life.

My life until today has been very private, originally from my style, but entering professional life without social media and making it until 35 was a blessing I didn't expect.
Between my two Instagram profiles, two Facebook profiles, two LinkedIn profiles, two Snapchat profiles and two TikTok profiles(see the pattern?), I've logged about 28 hours of shit time exploring mostly what looks like an agglomeration of my Pornhub.com taste in women over the last seven days. I quit the stuff while I was at Slippery Rock in 2010, nearly 15 years ago. Roughly working out to 2.5 years, I cannot complain about lost time. Thanks, college Ted. You didn't study but you set yourself up for success by being different from the rest. I've seen a lot in the last fifteen years and those extra 2.5 years are a bonus windfall that I earned and deserved. Lucky me.
